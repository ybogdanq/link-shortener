If you prefer to do it manually with the cleaner git history

```bash
npx degit jvidalv/vital my-vital-app
cd my-vital-app
yarn # If you don't have yarn installed, run: npm install -g yarn
```

### Development

Just run and visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Build

To build the App, run

```bash
yarn build
```

And you will see the generated file in `dist` that ready to be served.
