# Application setup

## Install dependencies

This template is using legacy dependencies, so we should run it with flag --legacy-deps

```bash
npm i --legacy-deps
```

## Run app

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Set up .env

You have .env.example file so you will be able to set it up manually
Currently we have only one dependency .env variable that uses Serverless backend.
